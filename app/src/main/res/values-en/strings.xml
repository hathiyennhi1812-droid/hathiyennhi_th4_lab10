    As a child, studying felt strange. Growing up, I realized the strange part was going to school.
    As a kid, I thought school was for meeting friends. Growing up, I found out it’s for meeting homework.
    As a kid, I thought studying was cool. Growing up, I found out studying means sleeping.
    As a kid, I thought a 10 meant I was smart. Growing up, I found out a 10 is just an illusion.
    As a kid, I thought the more I studied, the smarter I’d get. Growing up, I found out the more I study, the more I forget 😅
